I am an international postdoctoral fellow with the [Japanese Society for the Promotion of Sceince](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/) hosted at the [National Institute of Informatics](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/) as part of the [Engineerable AI project](https://engineerable.ai/en/).

My research interest lies mainly in Software Engineering, with a focus on assessing and generating software tests.
