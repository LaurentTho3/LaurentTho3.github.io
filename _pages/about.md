I am a research fellow at [Trinity College Dublin](https://tcd.ie), where I am part of the [Complex Software Laboratory](https://csl.scss.tcd.ie/) and [SFI Lero](https://lero.ie/).

My research interest lies mainly in Software Engineering, with a focus on assessing and generating software tests. In particular, I work on mutation analysis, a fault-based technique used to assess the quality of tests.
