I am an international postdoctoral fellow with the [Japanese Society for the Promotion of Sceince](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/) hosted at the [National Institute of Informatics](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/) as part of the [Engineerable AI project](https://engineerable.ai/en/). I am also a visiting postdoctoral researcher at [Trinity College Dublin](https://tcd.ie), where I am part of the [Complex Software Laboratory](https://csl.scss.tcd.ie/).

My research interest lies mainly in Software Engineering, with a focus on assessing and generating software tests. In particular, I work on mutation analysis, a fault-based technique usd to assess the quality of tests.
